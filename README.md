# GameDevPortfolio
Here, you can find a collection of my game development projects. Below are links to projects I've worked on, followed by some smaller sample projects that showcase my skills.
I'm experienced in code optimization, refactoring legacy systems, and working with diverse codebases written by different developers. I enjoy diving into complex technical challenges and ensuring both performance and maintainability.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the games I have developed or contributed to that are (or soon will be available) on Steam:

- **[Occupy Mars: The Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/758690/)**
  - Served as Assistant Project Leader.
  - Functioned as a Gameplay Programmer, engaging in all aspects of the production process.
  - Developed a system for procedurally generating objects and loot on maps.
  - Trained an AI robot companion for players using ML-Agents.
  - Created tools for level designers.
  - Developed a Quest system.
  - Assisted in implementing multiplayer features.
  - Optimized the game for Steamdeck.

- **[Overgrown Cleaner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164790/)**
  - Lead team of 3 programmers
  - Worked on base game mechanics
  - Worked with Foliage, Gameplay Ability System, and Behaviour Trees
  - Worked on game optimization


I worked on optimization of:
 - **[Dinosaur Forsil Hunter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/864700/)**
 - **[Castle Flipper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/944250/)**


I'm also working on a personal project: 
- **[Tactical Strategy Inspired by Fire Emblem Series](https://github.com/PanSkrzynka/GameDevPortfolio/tree/master/Unreal/ParableofReEvolution)**

Additionally, I worked on the OpenCoop GameINN project. Although the project was carried out by a team of advanced developers, I served as the main programming coordinator.
**[Gov project link](https://www.gov.pl/web/ncbr-en/development-of-an-innovative-opencoop-system-for-creating-and-adding-an-online-cooperative-mode-to-single-player-simulator-games)**
 - Designed the flow of adding Coop functionality into an existing Unity projects.
 - Implemented an auto-editing code system that identifies areas for change and highlights those requiring manual editing.
 - Created a machine learning model to assess the feasibility of converting games into co-op mode.
